The refactoring into a separate `parseForm` function improves readability and maintainability. The addition of a 400 error for missing email/password is a good addition.  The code uses async/await appropriately.  The commit message, while brief, is adequate. However, the lack of explicit input validation (beyond checking for null/undefined email and password) is a concern.  The suggested use of Zod for validation is a good idea, but not implemented. The absence of any mention of testing makes it difficult to assign a higher score.  We can assume some tests exist, given the functionality, but the commit provides no evidence or assurance of adequate test coverage.",

While the description links to a related issue,  it lacks detail on the specific improvements. The diff shows an addition of `Fields` and `Files` from the `formidable` library, suggesting a change to how form data is handled in the sign-in API.  However, without more context within the commit message or a more descriptive PR description, the extent of these changes and their impact are unclear. The lack of review comments doesn't necessarily indicate high quality, it could just mean nobody reviewed it yet.  There's no mention of testing, which is a major concern.  The code snippet is too small to assess for best practices like error handling, but the lack of information around the change makes assessing its completeness and quality difficult.
