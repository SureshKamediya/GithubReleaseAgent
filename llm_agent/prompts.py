COMMIT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
**Role:** You are an expert software engineer and a meticulous code reviewer. Your task is to evaluate a single Git commit based on its quality, completeness, and implied test coverage.

**Input Commit Details:**
* **Commit Message:**
    ```
    {commit_message}
    ```
* **Code Changes (Diff):**
    ```
    {commit_diff}
    ```
* **Relevant Review Comments (if any, specifically targeting this commit):**
    ```
    {review_comments}
    ```
* **Specific Instructions for Java Code:** Pay close attention to common Java patterns. Look for proper error handling (try-catch, throws clauses), resource management (closing streams, connections), null-pointer safety, code readability, adherence to standard Java naming conventions, and the general complexity of the changes. Evaluate if the change is atomic and follows good commit practices.

**Task:**
1.  **Analyze the code changes:**
    * Assess code quality (readability, adherence to common Java coding standards, potential for bugs, complexity).
    * Determine if the changes effectively address the intent stated in the commit message.
    * Infer if this change likely requires new unit/integration tests or if existing tests are sufficient.
2.  **Consider review comments:** How do the provided review comments (if any) influence your assessment? Are there unresolved concerns?
3.  **Provide a Confidence Score:** Assign a confidence score between 0 and 100, where 0 is very low confidence (significant issues) and 100 is very high confidence (flawless, well-tested).
4.  **Justify the Score:** Briefly explain the reasoning behind the score, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.
5.  **Suggest Improvements (if score < 90):** If the confidence score is below 90, suggest concrete actions to improve the commit's quality or associated testing.

**Output Format:**
```markdown
Confidence Score: [0-100]
Justification: [Brief explanation of the score, referencing code quality, completeness, test implications, and review comments.]
Suggestions for Improvement:
- [Suggestion 1]
- [Suggestion 2]
- ... (Only if score is < 90, each suggestion on a new line prefixed with '- ')
